    ## FetcherBot
    #### A Selenium-based web automation class designed to interact with specific web pages, handle navigation, and perform various actions such as selecting sites from a dropdown menu, clicking buttons to navigate through pages, and handling login confirmation.\n
    #### Methods:

    - `go_to_url(url: str) -> bool`:
        - Navigates to the given URL.
        - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

    - `select_site(site_name: str) -> bool`:
        - Selects a specific site from a dropdown menu.
        - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

    - `click_100_views_button() -> bool`:
        - Clicks the button to display 100 views on a web page.
        - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

    - `click_next_page_button() -> bool`:
        - Clicks the button to navigate to the next page.
        - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

    - `get_login_confirmation() -> bool`:
        - Prompts the user to confirm login using a dialog box.
        - Returns the result of the user's confirmation.

    - `update_site(data: dict) -> Optional[dict]`:
        - Updates the site with the provided data by filling in a form.
        - Returns relevant data if successful, None otherwise.

    - `find_matching_addresses_from_table(data: dict) -> bool`:
        - Finds matching addresses from a table and performs related actions.
        - Returns True if successful, False otherwise.

    #### Attributes:

    - `self.driver`:
        - The Selenium WebDriver instance used to interact with the web browser.

    - `self.xpath_iframe_complete`:
        - XPATH for the iframe to be selected (used in `select_site` method).

    #### Usage:
    - Initialize an instance of the FetcherBot class with appropriate configurations.
    - Use the available methods to navigate and interact with specific web pages.

    #### Note:
    - Ensure that the WebDriver is correctly initialized and configured before using this class.
    - Be aware of the specific web elements and structures that this class is designed to interact with.
